In this project I learned how to transform static web pages into dynamic applications and how to create and use JavaScript objects and functions. I learned how to use variables, data structures, conditional statements, loops, and function in JavaScript.Manage web page content using Javascript features including DOM element selections,traversal and manipulation. And use some new features introduced to the Javascript language in ECMAScript 2015.
